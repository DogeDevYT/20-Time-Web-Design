            Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that
            inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. The DNA of
            gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95â€“99% depending
            on what is counted, and they are the next closest living relatives
            to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos.

            Gorillas are divided into two species and either four or five
            subspecies. The mountain gorilla, the eastern lowland gorilla, and
            the western lowland gorilla are critically endangered.

            Gorillas are peaceful animals and are mostly herbivorous. Their diet
            primarily consists of leaves, stems, bamboo shoots, and fruits.
            Gorillas rarely drink water, as they get most of the moisture they
            need from their vegetarian diet.
